We have selected topics from the lower Secondary Science curriculum that are difficult to teach and common across all countries. The units are grouped into five pedagogical themes, which reflect the skills and attributes of an effective teacher. They are: Probing students\u2019 understandingMaking Science practicalMaking Science real and relevantProblem-solving and creativityTeaching challenging ideasEach theme is exemplified in Biology (Module 1), Chemistry (Module 2) and Physics (Module 3), making a total of 15 units. \u00a0If the topic that you are teaching is not covered, then we hope that you will be able to adapt one of the units to the context that you require. If you would prefer to focus on one pedagogical theme then download all the section 1s in order to learn about \u2018probing childrens\u2019 understanding\u2019; section 2s to learn about \u2018making science practical\u2019; section 3s to learn about \u2018making science relevant and real\u2019; section 4s to learn about \u2018problem-solving and creativity\u2019; and section 5s to learn and \u2018teaching challenging ideas\u2019.",
